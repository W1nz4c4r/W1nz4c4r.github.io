title: Netmon - Hack The Box
excerpt: Netmon is an easy Hack The Box machine in which we will have anonymous login access were we will be able to get the user flags right away. then for the intrusion on the machine we will found a config file
that has some credentials and we will have access to the PRTG network Monitor administrator page were we will be able to run remote code execution as administrator thanks to the PRGT vesion being used. for this intrusion we will create a new user and add it to the administators group, finally we access to the machine with evil-winrm and using the newly created user

**Machine IP = 10.10.10.152**

To begin with this machine we need to start with some basic steps by sending the *nmap* commands checking the network:
  * nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- -vvv 10.10.10.95 -oA nmap/allPorts

```

## Enumeration

We start by login in to port 21 which it is ftp because the nmap scan tells us that anonymous login is allowed.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p1.png)

As we can see it seems that on the FTP we have access to  the low privileges user desktop, from there we can do a **get user.txt** so will be able to see (cat/type) its content.
Then what we do is go to our web browser and navigate to *http://10.10.10.152/* and we found a login page for PRTG Network monitor, We tried some **default** passwords but nothing works.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p2.png)

After that we go back to the FTP server because it seems that it has the entire HD mounted on the port. After some time looking we are able to find **programdata/paessler/PRTG Network Monitor** and we find some *PRTG Network Monitor configuration files*.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p3.png)

with *diff*  we check the differences between the **PRTG Conifgutation.old** and **PRTG Conifgutation.old.bak**.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p4.png)

here we can see what there is a possible user and password:
  * prtgadmin --> PrTg@dmin2018
We try the credentials on PRTg loggin page but they dont work. we check the two files and realize that the **PRTG configuration.old.bak** is form the year 2018 while the  **PRTG configuration.old** is form 2019.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p5.png)

Now we try :
 *  **user**: prtgadmin
 * **pass**: PrTg@dmin2019

 We got access to PRTG administration page.

 ![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p6.png)

Now that we have some extra information we could look something about the program being used in *searchsploit*


 ![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p7.png)


we look the first result that appears (Remote code execution "Authentificated") and all its information is url encrypted.
We look for a URL decrypter and check the file. The first part of the script refers on how to create a new user in the machine and how to do it.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p8.png)

in the script says where to place all the "code" we need to gain the remote code execution.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p10.png)

we follow the second part of the script.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p9.png)

and here we can see how it is supossed to go the information.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p11.png)

After we run the commands we can check with crackmapexec to check if the creation of the user and its addition to administrators group work correctly.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p12.png)

As we can see after we run the code with crackmapexec we are able to see that next to the user we just created it says the user us valid and **pwn3d**.

We use *evil-winrm* with the credentials just created.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-Netmon/p13.png)

Finally , we go to administrator desktop and get the root.txt
